//! peaky phone fires, single-frame noise does not, a steady turn crosses once,
//! a calm session is silent, and the same input twice gives the same output.
//!
//! Hand-built rather than recorded on purpose. A corpus of real clips is
//! better evidence and is being gathered separately; these exist so a
//! regression is caught by `cargo test` rather than by a person staring at a
//! HUD wondering why nothing fired.
