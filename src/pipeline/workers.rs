//! The worker loops (MODELS.md §6).
//!
//! Four threads: capture, detect (face -> pose -> gaze at 15 Hz), objects at
//! 1 Hz, and identity at 0.2 Hz. Each of the three model workers owns its own
//! `last_seen` cursor over the same latest-frame bus and its own sessions, so
//! adding one never changed the others — which is why the topology in
//! MODELS.md §6 could be built in three separate steps.
//!
//! Every worker obeys the same three rules: it owns its sessions outright, it
//! reads the latest frame rather than a queue, and it never blocks capture.
